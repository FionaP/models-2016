@misc{Duval2006,
abstract = {cit{\'{e}} 813 fois, avril 2016. To understand the difficulties that many students have with comprehension of mathematics, we must determine the cognitive functioning underlying the diversity of mathematical processes. What are the cognitive systems that are required to give access to mathematical objects? Are these systems common to all processes of knowledge or, on the contrary, some of them are specific to mathematical activity? Starting from the paramount importance of semiotic representation for any mathematical activity, we put forward a classification of the various registers of semiotic representations that are mobilized in mathematical processes. Thus, we can reveal two types of transformation of semiotic representations: treatment and conversion. These two types correspond to quite different cognitive processes. They are two separate sources of incomprehension in the learning of mathematics. If treatment is the more important from a mathematical point of view, conversion is basically the deciding factor for learning. Supporting empirical data, at any level of curriculum and for any area of mathematics, can be widely and methodologically gathered: some empirical evidence is presented in this paper.},

@inproceedings{Yohannis2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. Algorithms are commonly perceived as a difficult subject, which is quite an irony as they have a fundamental role in computer science. Failure to master this subject will inhibit students" capabilities as they advance to higher levels. Algorithm visualization, as an effort to overcome the problem, has been growing towards gameful visualization recently that is presumed to be able to engage learners longer and more intensely. However, integrating algorithm visualization, game elements, and instructional design is not a trivial task as it requires a careful design. Hence, a conceptual model of how algorithm learning instructions, algorithm visualization, and gamification improve learning outcomes was developed. While instructional design concerns with developing the best strategy for learning, algorithm visualization functions as a cognitive support provider and gamification works by delivering engagement. Both cognitive support and engagement moderate the learning instructions that concern with enhancing learning outcomes. Principles and elements originating from the three domains have to be taken into consideration during the designing process to produce an artifact that can deliver the essential functions of each domain. A working artifact was then constructed, as the instantiation of the model, to validate whether the idea of integrating algorithm visualization and gamification into algorithm learning instructions is capable enough to improve learning outcomes. Based on our respondents" learning outcomes, it was found the artifact can significantly improve the procedural knowledge of learners that are indicated by their increased capability in solving sorting algorithm problems.},

@article{Ibanez2014,
abstract = {Gamification is the use of game design elements in non-game settings to engage participants and encourage desired behaviours. It has been identified as a promising technique to improve students' engagement which could have a positive impact on learning. This study evaluated the learning effectiveness and engagement appeal of a gamified learning activity targeted at the learning of C-programming language. Furthermore, the study inquired into which gamified learning activities were more appealing to students. The study was conducted using the mixed-method sequential explanatory protocol. The data collected and analysed included logs, questionnaires, and pre- and post-tests. The results of the evaluation show positive effects on the engagement of students toward the gamified learning activities and a moderate improvement in learning outcomes. Students reported different motivations for continuing and stopping activities once they completed the mandatory assignment. The preferences for different gamified activities were also conditioned by academic milestones.},
